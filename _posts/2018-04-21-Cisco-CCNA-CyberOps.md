> What’s better than getting professional certifications? – Getting it for free!

I obtained the CCNA CyberOps certification in Jan 2018. Here’s what I think about it.

## What’s CyberOps?
Cisco introduced a $10 million scholarship late 2016 to solve the cybersecurity talent shortage – specially Tier 1 security analysts performing grunt work in a SOC (Security Operations Centre). This Cyber Operations Certification [Cyber Operations Certification][1] was tailored for SOC work and the scholarship was Cisco’s method of beta testing the course (and putting Cisco products in our heads). The course is made up of 2 modules & Exams – Cybersecurity Fundamentals (SECFND) & Cybersecurity Operations (SECOPS)

## How to sign up?
Scholarship signups are currently closed, but there's no harm checking [the site here][2] with your fingers crossed that Cisco will re-open slots.

To qualify, I filled in a short questionnaire that asks for info on gender, military experience, cybersecurity experience, or having other certifications. I qualified with 2 factors (I think) – Having 1 year of Cybersecurity experience and CISA Certification.

The next stage was a skill assessment with around 65 questions on Windows, Linux, Networking, and Security. My Security+ foundations helped quite a bit here (Thanks CompTIA!) and I got myself a scholarship spot!

## The Lessons
The course syllabus covered a wide scope of networking & security knowledge and I would gladly recommend it to beginners. From the lessons, I got a better understanding of networking & security concepts, attack methods, incident response, how the SOC works, SIEMs and how to correlate logs.

Training Content was delivered on Lumicybersecurity’s training portal through:
- Self-paced video lessons
- Labs
- Live Web sessions with an Instructor

The video content played nice on all my devices (My Ipad, Laptop, & surprise surprise, even my 5″ Android phone).
I found it easy to grasp the lessons delivered in the videos. The animated illustrations was nicely done and was a good aid to visualise networking concepts. However, halfway through the course, I got a sense that the lesson sequence was not very well structured because there were **looaaaaaads** of content repetition as you progress. Some repeated topics were even just a few sentences long, making me feel that they put there as filler to make the course outline look long.

Sadly I did not attend the live web sessions as they clashed with my work schedule, but the notes that came from it were beneficial as it gave emphasis on what you needed to focus on to pass the exam.

Labs
------

Ah, the part I’m most impressed by — The Labs

![Lab Time!][Labss]

### The Good
**All In Browser** – In my previous learnings, setting up the VM & labs to follow along with the book usually frustrated me the most. Time meant for working through the intended hands on session, was instead spent on troubleshooting and googling for solutions. So for Cisco to have everything set up in a browser was a big win! You just had to get in queue while the lab is being prepared.

**Good VMs** – We had Windows, Kali Linux, Security Onion, Cisco Routers & Firewalls. Good choice of commonly used distros in the real world.
Detailed Explanations – the step by step instructions included was extremely helpful because it had detailed explanations for each step that you’re doing.
The lab activities were brilliant! We played around with Wireshark, the SIEM in Security Onion, and I’d always end up experimenting around longer than my estimated time. Thumbs up to Cisco for the labs!

### The Negatives

Okay, it’s not all rosy. There is a price to pay for Lab-in-Browser convenience.

**Input Lag & Bandwidth** - Because it’s all in the browser and hosted in a server far away from Asia, the latency delay is definitely felt (Time between u pressing a key, and it appearing on screen). And if you’re picky about that, that can get annoying quick.

I also had a few time outs when the server was overloaded, and had to join a waiting queue to reload the lab.

**Display Resolution** – Another hassle was trying to display the various VMs side by side. Things can get real cramped with lots of confused alt-tabbing and clicking if you’re on a smaller resolution(like 768p). Fortunately for me, I'm on a 1440p monitor, so it wasn’t that bad.

## The Exam
Booking the exam was easy as it was administered through Pearson’s portal.

The exam itself however, was quite a disappointment for me. Among all the multichoice question certs I’ve taken, Cisco’s one is the most badly worded. For example, CISA had tricky phrasing, Security+ was pretty straight to the point, SANS open book style tests your underlying knowledge of the topic (half of whih is not in the book). CyberOps questions however, (quite a few) will leave you scratching your head wondering what the question actually wants you to answer. With that, extra study, reading the question properly and shooting educated guesses on what it wants are definitely required to pass the exam.

I passed both papers with single attempts, and both within an hour! Stress & anxiety levels were low because Cisco offered an extra voucher if you failed an attempt. (Haha, #nopressure). On the difficulty side, it is pretty easy to pass if you've got a solid understanding of the material covered. Between the two, I found SECOPS easier and even bagged a higher score compared to SECFND. (Which is what most coursemates online find to be harder).
 
## Conclusion & Value
If the thrill of working in Incident Response appeals to you and you have decided that being a SOC analyst is in your career path, this could be the entry level cert you might want to look at because it covers the basic incident response techniques pretty well. 

If you are fairly new to security and IT fundamentals, I'd recommend the Routing and Switching certificate, or CompTIA's A+, Network+ &Security+ trio instead. 

The value of the certification however is still relatively unknown. Performing a search on jobsites show the CCNA postings that refer to the popular CCNA - Routing+Switching. Plus, SOC positions do not mention Cyberops in their requirements. I guess it’ll probably be a few years before we’ll find out if it becomes mainstream.

As for time required, The course materials were made available on the portal for 3 months. I also had to block time on my calendar to complete the course because the materials covered were pretty comprehensive if you’re fairly new to networking. 

Overall, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of how a SOC works along with incident analysis experience using SIEMs from the hands on labs. The labs prepared by LumiCybersecurity was the best thing in the course. The frustrations I had stem mainly from the exam questions phrasing as well as topic sequence. If I had to pay for it (either personally or through training budgets), I would not have taken it as being an IR is not my thing. But I am thankful for the opportunity given, and it was time well spent indeed!
